The key technical contributions of this research span multiple domains within autonomous systems, each addressing specific challenges in aerial robotics. In the perception domain, the optimized computer vision system demonstrates efficient real-time object detection and classification within the computational constraints of an embedded platform. The custom implementation and optimization of the YOLOv8 architecture achieves 92% detection accuracy while maintaining 30ms processing times, enabled through transfer learning, network pruning, quantization, and TensorRT acceleration. These techniques collectively reduce inference time by 62% and memory usage by 47% compared to the baseline implementation, establishing effective methodologies for deploying sophisticated perception capabilities on resource-constrained platforms. In the navigation domain, the research demonstrates effective integration of the industry-standard QGroundControl platform with custom extensions for enhanced autonomous functionality. This approach balances reliability and innovation, leveraging established tools while extending their capabilities through specialized modules for mission planning, real-time monitoring, and integration with custom obstacle avoidance. The resulting navigation framework provides intuitive operation while enabling advanced autonomous behaviors that exceed the capabilities of standard commercial implementations.

The multi-layered obstacle avoidance architecture represents a particularly significant contribution, addressing the fundamental challenge of safe navigation in complex environments. The three-tier design effectively allocates computational resources according to the immediacy of collision threats, with the high-frequency reactive layer providing immediate safety, the medium-frequency predictive layer enabling smooth and efficient avoidance, and the low-frequency strategic layer optimizing global routes. This approach achieves higher avoidance success rates and greater efficiency than single-strategy implementations, demonstrating the effectiveness of integrating complementary methods with appropriate resource allocation. The implementation of class-specific avoidance behaviors based on obstacle type further enhances system performance, adapting safety margins and avoidance strategies to the characteristics and risks associated with different obstacles. These innovations in the obstacle avoidance domain contribute valuable approaches to the broader field of autonomous navigation, applicable beyond aerial platforms to other mobile robotic systems facing similar challenges in dynamic environment navigation.

The system integration methodology demonstrates effective techniques for combining diverse components into a cohesive autonomous platform while maintaining reliability and performance. The layered software architecture with well-defined interfaces enables independent development and testing of components while ensuring effective cooperation within the integrated system. The mixed-criticality approach prioritizes safety-critical functions while efficiently allocating resources across competing demands, ensuring robust operation even under computational constraints. The fault tolerance mechanisms implement graceful degradation when components encounter limitations or failures, maintaining basic functionality through redundancy and alternative processing pathways. These system integration approaches address a significant gap identified in the literature review, providing practical methodologies for developing complex autonomous systems that maintain reliability across diverse operating conditions. The documented challenges and solutions contribute valuable insights for future autonomous system development, highlighting the importance of holistic design that considers component interactions and resource limitations throughout the development process.

Practical implications of this research extend to various application domains where autonomous drone capabilities enable new operational possibilities. Infrastructure inspection applications benefit from the system's ability to navigate complex structures while maintaining appropriate standoff distances, capturing detailed imagery without requiring manual control. Environmental monitoring operations leverage the autonomous navigation capabilities to execute precise survey patterns across large areas, ensuring consistent data collection with minimal operator intervention. Emergency response scenarios utilize the obstacle avoidance capabilities to safely navigate complex environments during time-critical missions, potentially accessing areas too dangerous for human entry. Urban monitoring applications employ the classification-specific behaviors to appropriately navigate areas with pedestrians and vehicles, maintaining suitable safety margins based on obstacle type. These diverse applications demonstrate the practical utility of the developed system beyond academic research, highlighting the potential for autonomous drone technology to enhance operational capabilities across multiple sectors while improving safety and efficiency compared to manually operated alternatives.

The research findings also contribute to the theoretical understanding of autonomous systems operating under resource constraints.

The perception-planning integration insights highlight the benefits of tight coupling between these systems, with classification-specific planning behaviors demonstrating substantially improved performance compared to generic approaches. The multi-resolution environmental representation strategies balance computational efficiency against planning precision, focusing detailed modeling on immediate surroundings while maintaining coarser representations for distant areas. These theoretical contributions advance the field's understanding of effective architectures and algorithms for autonomous systems operating with limited computational, energy, and sensing resources, applicable across various robotic platforms facing similar constraints. The quantitative performance evaluations provide valuable reference points for future research, establishing benchmarks for autonomous capabilities on comparable hardware platforms.

Limitations identified through extensive field testing provide important context for understanding the system's capabilities and constraints. Perception limitations primarily affect the detection of thin obstacles at extended ranges and operation in challenging lighting or weather conditions, constraining operational parameters in these scenarios. Navigation constraints include cumulative drift in GPS-denied environments and reduced performance in extremely cluttered settings where maneuvering space becomes highly limited. Energy limitations restrict typical mission durations to approximately 20 minutes, necessitating careful mission planning to operate within this constraint. These limitations do not represent fundamental flaws in the approach but rather define the operational boundaries within which the system functions reliably. Understanding these constraints is essential for appropriate deployment and operational planning, ensuring that missions remain within the system's validated capabilities. The clearly documented limitations also provide valuable direction for future research and development, highlighting specific areas where enhanced capabilities would expand the system's operational envelope.

Future research directions identified based on the current implementation and field testing results offer promising paths for continued advancement. Enhanced perception capabilities through multi-modal sensing would address current limitations in challenging environmental conditions, complementing vision-based detection with LiDAR or radar sensing for improved reliability across diverse scenarios. Advanced learning-based approaches to obstacle avoidance could improve performance in complex dynamic environments by developing policies that learn from experience and anticipate obstacle movements more effectively than current prediction models. Collaborative multi-drone systems represent an exciting extension of the current approach, enabling coordinated operation across multiple platforms with shared perception and planning capabilities. Energy-aware mission planning incorporating terrain models, wind predictions, and battery characteristics would optimize route selection for maximum efficiency, extending effective mission ranges within battery constraints. These research directions build upon the solid foundation established in the current work, addressing identified limitations while extending capabilities to support more demanding applications and operating environments.
