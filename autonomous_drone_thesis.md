## 1. Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), commonly known as drones, have evolved significantly in recent years, transitioning from remote-controlled flying devices to sophisticated autonomous systems. This evolution has expanded their application domains from military operations to civilian uses including package delivery, surveillance, search and rescue, agriculture, and infrastructure inspection. A critical capability for these applications is autonomous navigationâ€”the ability to fly from one point to another without human intervention while safely avoiding obstacles.

This thesis addresses the challenge of developing a fully autonomous drone system capable of navigating between predefined waypoints while detecting and avoiding obstacles in real-time. The system combines advanced hardware components including the NVIDIA Jetson for computational tasks, Pixhawk 6X flight controller for flight stabilization and navigation, multiple cameras for environmental perception, and LIDAR for precise distance measurements.

The primary contributions of this research include:

1. A comprehensive hardware and software architecture for autonomous drone navigation
2. Implementation of a YOLOv8-based computer vision system for real-time detection of common outdoor obstacles
3. Development of a hybrid obstacle avoidance algorithm leveraging both vision and LIDAR data
4. Extensive testing and validation in various environmental conditions
5. Performance analysis and optimization techniques for resource-constrained aerial platforms

The successful implementation of such a system has significant implications for drone applications requiring operation in complex environments without direct human control. The remainder of this thesis details the design, implementation, testing, and results of our autonomous drone system.

## 2. Literature Review <a name="literature-review"></a>

Autonomous navigation for drones has been an active area of research for the past decade. This section reviews relevant literature in the domains of drone navigation, obstacle detection and avoidance, and computer vision applications for UAVs.

### 2.1 Autonomous Navigation Systems

Autonomous navigation for UAVs has evolved from basic GPS waypoint following to sophisticated systems capable of operating in GPS-denied environments. Scaramuzza et al. (2014) presented one of the early comprehensive surveys on vision-based navigation for micro aerial vehicles. Their work highlighted the challenges of computational constraints on small UAVs and proposed solutions leveraging visual odometry.

More recently, Cesare et al. (2020) demonstrated a multi-sensor fusion approach combining visual inertial odometry with GPS for robust localization. Their system showed improved resilience to GPS signal loss and environmental disturbances.

### 2.2 Obstacle Detection and Avoidance

Obstacle detection and avoidance algorithms can be broadly categorized into reactive and deliberative approaches. Reactive methods like potential field methods (Khatib, 1986) and vector field histograms (Borenstein and Koren, 1991) provide immediate responses to detected obstacles but may trap the drone in local minima.

Deliberative approaches include sampling-based methods like Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT) and Probabilistic Roadmaps (PRM). These methods, as demonstrated by Karaman and Frazzoli (2011), offer more optimal paths but require more computational resources.

### 2.3 Computer Vision for Drone Navigation

Computer vision has become a cornerstone of modern drone navigation systems. Traditional computer vision approaches relied on feature detection and tracking methods such as SIFT, SURF, and ORB. However, deep learning methods have significantly outperformed these traditional approaches in recent years.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been widely applied for drone navigation tasks. Loquercio et al. (2018) demonstrated a CNN-based approach for obstacle avoidance using a single camera. Their DroNet architecture allowed a drone to navigate through urban environments by learning from car and bicycle datasets.

### 2.4 YOLO for Drone Applications

You Only Look Once (YOLO) has emerged as a popular object detection architecture for drone applications due to its balance between accuracy and speed. Ultralytics' YOLOv8, released in 2023, offers significant improvements in both detection accuracy and inference speed compared to previous versions.

Kim et al. (2022) utilized YOLOv7 for drone-based detection of power lines, achieving 89% detection accuracy. Similarly, Nguyen et al. (2023) implemented YOLOv8 for real-time detection of urban obstacles, reporting 92% accuracy with inference times below 20ms on NVIDIA Jetson platforms.

### 2.5 Sensor Fusion

Sensor fusion approaches combining cameras with depth sensors like LIDAR have shown promising results for robust obstacle avoidance. Zhang and Singh (2018) presented a method fusing visual and LIDAR data for improved odometry and mapping in challenging environments. Their approach demonstrated resilience to varying lighting conditions and dynamic obstacles.

### 2.6 Research Gap

Despite significant advancements, existing literature reveals gaps in creating fully integrated autonomous drone systems that can:
1. Detect diverse obstacles (both natural and man-made) with high reliability
2. Operate in real-time on embedded hardware platforms
3. Navigate efficiently while avoiding obstacles
