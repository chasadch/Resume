## Abstract

This thesis presents the development, implementation, and evaluation of an autonomous drone system capable of navigating complex environments through effective perception, planning, and obstacle avoidance. The research addresses significant challenges in real-time environmental understanding, efficient path planning, and reliable obstacle avoidance while operating within the strict computational and energy constraints inherent to aerial platforms. The system incorporates a YOLOv8-based computer vision framework optimized for embedded deployment on a Jetson Xavier NX platform, a QGroundControl-based navigation system with custom extensions for autonomous operation, and a multi-layered obstacle avoidance architecture that integrates reactive, predictive, and strategic approaches. Comprehensive testing demonstrates 95% mission completion rates across diverse environments, with navigation precision maintained within Â±0.5m and obstacle avoidance success rates exceeding 98% for static obstacles. The integrated system achieves real-time performance within the computational and energy constraints of the aerial platform, with flight endurance of approximately 20 minutes during autonomous operation. The research contributes effective methodologies for system integration, perception optimization, and obstacle avoidance that advance the state of the art in autonomous aerial robotics while maintaining practical viability for real-world applications. The documented performance characteristics, operational boundaries, and future research directions provide valuable insights for continued advancement in autonomous drone capabilities for applications including infrastructure inspection, environmental monitoring, and emergency response.
