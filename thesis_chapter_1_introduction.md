# Chapter 1: Introduction

## 1.1 Background and Motivation

Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), commonly known as drones, have transformed from specialized military assets to versatile platforms serving diverse civilian applications over the past decade. This evolution has been fueled by advances in miniaturized sensors, embedded computing, battery technology, and artificial intelligence, enabling increasingly sophisticated autonomous capabilities. The integration of these technologies has positioned UAVs at the forefront of innovation in robotics, offering unique advantages in mobility, accessibility, and perspective that are unmatched by ground-based platforms.

The motivation for developing autonomous drone systems stems from their potential to revolutionize numerous industries and services. In infrastructure inspection, drones can efficiently access and assess difficult-to-reach structures such as bridges, power lines, and tall buildings, reducing human risk and inspection costs while providing more consistent and detailed data. Environmental monitoring applications leverage drones to track wildlife, assess habitat changes, and monitor environmental parameters across large or inaccessible areas. In agriculture, autonomous drones enable precision farming through crop monitoring, disease detection, and targeted resource application. Emergency response scenarios benefit from drones' ability to rapidly assess disaster areas, locate survivors, and deliver critical supplies without risking human responders.

Despite these promising applications, significant challenges persist in developing truly autonomous drone systems capable of reliable, independent operation in complex, unstructured environments. Current commercial systems predominantly rely on Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) navigation with limited obstacle detection and avoidance capabilities, restricting their operation to carefully controlled environments with minimal obstacles. Advanced perception, navigation, and decision-making capabilities remain areas of active research, with performance and reliability gaps hindering widespread deployment in safety-critical or fully autonomous applications.

## 1.2 Problem Statement

The central problem addressed in this thesis is the development of an integrated autonomous drone system capable of navigating from point to point in semi-structured environments while reliably detecting and avoiding obstacles in real-time. This problem encompasses several interconnected challenges:

First, the perception challenge involves developing a system that can reliably detect and classify various obstacle types in real-time within the computational constraints of an airborne platform. Environmental factors such as variable lighting, weather conditions, and complex backgrounds further complicate this task, necessitating robust computer vision algorithms that balance accuracy with computational efficiency.

Second, the navigation challenge requires developing path planning algorithms that can efficiently generate optimal trajectories while accounting for identified obstacles, dynamic constraints of the aerial platform, and energy considerations. The system must maintain spatial awareness during flight, continuously updating its understanding of the environment and adjusting plans accordingly.

Third, the obstacle avoidance challenge demands real-time response capabilities that can rapidly generate and execute maneuvers to avoid both static and dynamic obstacles. These avoidance strategies must handle varying obstacle types, unexpected encounters, and maintain safety margins while balancing mission objectives.

Fourth, the integration challenge involves combining these perception, planning, and control components into a cohesive system that operates reliably within the power, weight, and computational constraints of the aerial platform. This integration must ensure appropriate information flow, synchronization between subsystems, and graceful degradation in case of component failures.

Addressing these challenges requires bridging the gap between theoretical approaches in robotics and practical implementation considerations, developing methodologies that work effectively on resource-constrained platforms in real-world conditions.

## 1.3 Research Objectives
