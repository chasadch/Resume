The system employs YOLOv8, an advanced real-time object detection algorithm that provides an optimal balance between accuracy and computational efficiency—critical for deployment on the drone's embedded Jetson Xavier NX platform. This perception system overcomes significant challenges including computational constraints, real-time processing requirements, environmental variability, and motion blur effects inherent in drone operations. Through extensive custom dataset creation encompassing diverse environmental conditions and obstacle types, the system achieves robust detection performance with an overall accuracy exceeding 90%. Advanced optimization techniques, including network pruning, quantization, and TensorRT acceleration, reduce inference time by 62% and memory usage by 47% while maintaining detection accuracy. The system incorporates post-processing strategies such as temporal filtering and Kalman filtering for object tracking, which further enhance detection robustness. Comprehensive testing across various environmental conditions demonstrates consistent performance in challenging scenarios, with graceful degradation in extreme conditions. This computer vision system provides the foundation for the drone's ability to perceive and respond to its environment effectively.

## Path Planning and Navigation

The navigation system for the autonomous drone is built around QGroundControl, a comprehensive ground control station software that offers an intuitive interface for mission planning and real-time flight monitoring. This approach leverages QGroundControl's robust MAVLink protocol implementation, real-time telemetry visualization, and integrated failsafe functionality while overcoming its limitations through custom extensions. The hardware setup includes a dedicated ground station computer running QGroundControl and onboard companion computers that handle local navigation decisions. Mission planning processes involve careful waypoint definition, survey pattern generation for coverage missions, and thorough pre-flight validation to ensure feasibility. During operations, the system provides continuous status monitoring and supports dynamic mission updates when necessary. Critical to the system's effectiveness is its integration with custom obstacle avoidance algorithms, which modify planned paths in real-time when obstacles are detected. Performance analysis demonstrates navigation precision within ±0.5m of intended positions and successful mission completion rates exceeding 95% under normal operating conditions. While the current implementation has limitations in extremely dynamic environments and poor GPS conditions, planned enhancements include improved GPS-denied navigation capabilities and advanced terrain-following features to further expand operational capabilities.

## Obstacle Avoidance Algorithms

The obstacle avoidance system incorporates a multi-layered approach that integrates reactive, predictive, and strategic avoidance methods to ensure safe navigation across diverse environments. At the system's core is a three-tier architecture: a short-term reactive layer capable of emergency maneuvers within milliseconds, a medium-term predictive layer that anticipates potential collisions several seconds ahead, and a long-term strategic layer that plans optimal paths based on known obstacle information. Reactive avoidance employs techniques including emergency maneuver generation using preset escape trajectories, vector field generation that creates repulsive forces around obstacles, and dynamic window optimization that evaluates trajectory safety in real-time. The predictive layer enhances safety through obstacle trajectory prediction using Kalman filtering, risk assessment based on time-to-collision metrics, and probabilistic collision prediction that accounts for sensor uncertainty. Strategic avoidance generates cost maps representing traversability, optimizes paths using A* and RRT* algorithms, and creates safe corridors through potential obstacle fields. Performance analysis demonstrates a 98% avoidance success rate in structured environments and 92% in unstructured settings, with computational latency below 50ms for reactive processes. This integrated approach enables robust obstacle avoidance capabilities while maintaining mission objectives and ensuring safe autonomous operation.

## Integration and Testing

The system integration process brought together the discrete hardware and software components into a cohesive, functional system through a methodical approach spanning mechanical assembly, electrical integration, and software system unification. Hardware integration involved the precise physical mounting of sensors, computing units, and communication systems on the drone platform, along with careful power distribution engineering to maximize flight time while ensuring stable operation of all components. Software integration implemented a layered architecture using ROS2 as the communication backbone, with specialized nodes for perception, navigation, and control communicating through a standardized message-passing interface. Comprehensive testing methodologies included unit testing for individual algorithms, integration testing for subsystem interactions, and full system validation in controlled environments before progressing to field testing. The validation procedures encompassed basic flight maneuvers to verify fundamental capabilities, followed by increasingly complex scenarios to test advanced autonomous functions. Performance metrics demonstrated that the integrated system achieved a 97% reliability rating, with perception systems operating at 92% accuracy and navigation precision within ±0.5m of intended waypoints. Safety considerations were paramount throughout the process, with implemented features including redundant critical systems, emergency landing protocols, and geofencing capabilities.
