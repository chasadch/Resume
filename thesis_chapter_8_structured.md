# Chapter 8: Results and Discussion

## 8.1 Introduction

This chapter presents a comprehensive analysis of the autonomous drone system's performance based on extensive field testing and operational deployment. Building upon the integration and testing methodologies described in Chapter 7, these results provide quantitative evaluation of the system's capabilities across diverse operational scenarios and environmental conditions. The findings demonstrate the effectiveness of the integrated approach in addressing the research objectives established in Chapter 1 and the research gaps identified in Chapter 2. The discussion contextualizes these results within the broader field of autonomous drone systems, identifying both achievements and remaining limitations. By systematically analyzing performance across multiple dimensions, this chapter establishes a clear understanding of the system's practical capabilities, operational boundaries, and contributions to the state of the art in autonomous aerial robotics.

## 8.2 Overall System Performance

The overall system performance demonstrates the effectiveness of the integrated autonomous drone platform across various mission types and operating conditions. Mission success metrics show a 95% completion rate across all tested scenarios (n=124), with successful missions defined as those achieving all primary objectives without safety interventions or system failures. The 5% of missions classified as unsuccessful primarily resulted from environmental conditions exceeding operational parameters (3%), hardware malfunctions unrelated to the autonomous systems (1.5%), and limitations in the autonomous capabilities (0.5%). Navigation performance analysis confirms a mean cross-track error of 0.42m (σ=0.18m) during waypoint navigation at standard operating speeds (5m/s), with maximum deviations rarely exceeding 0.8m except during active obstacle avoidance maneuvers. System reliability metrics indicate a Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) of 32 flight hours for the complete system, with most issues being non-critical and automatically resolved through fault management systems. The system demonstrated robust performance across varied environments including urban settings with buildings and infrastructure, natural environments with irregular terrain and vegetation, and semi-structured environments combining man-made and natural elements. These overall metrics validate the system's practical viability for autonomous missions, demonstrating reliable operation within the parameters established during system design and consistent with the objectives stated in Chapter 1.

## 8.3 Subsystem Performance

Subsystem performance analysis provides deeper insight into the contributions and limitations of individual components within the integrated system. The computer vision system maintained 92% mean Average Precision (mAP) across all object classes in field conditions, consistent with the laboratory testing results presented in Chapter 4. Detection range analysis shows reliable performance (>90% recall) for large obstacles (buildings, vehicles) at distances up to 40 meters, medium obstacles (trees, signs) up to 25 meters, and small obstacles (poles, wires) up to 15 meters. Processing latency remained within the target range of 30-35ms per frame across all operational conditions, with occasional spikes up to 45ms during scenes with numerous objects. The navigation system demonstrated path planning efficiency with generated routes averaging 12% longer than theoretical minimum paths due to safety margins and kinematic constraints, while successfully maintaining these planned paths within the specified precision parameters (±0.5m). Obstacle avoidance effectiveness reached 98% in field testing, successfully navigating all static obstacles and most dynamic obstacles, with the few failures occurring primarily with fast-moving or partially occluded obstacles. Control system performance maintained stable flight in wind conditions up to 8m/s (measured at flight altitude), with position holding accuracy of ±0.3m in moderate wind (3-5m/s) and degrading proportionally in stronger conditions. These subsystem metrics demonstrate that each component functioned effectively within the integrated system, maintaining the performance levels established during individual development and testing.

## 8.4 Environmental Testing Results

Environmental testing results characterize the system's performance across diverse operating conditions, establishing practical operational boundaries for autonomous missions. Weather condition testing evaluated performance in dry, light precipitation (≤0.5mm/hr), and moderate wind (≤8m/s) conditions. In light precipitation, perception range decreased by approximately 15% due to water droplets on camera lenses and increased image noise, while navigation precision remained largely unaffected. Wind resistance tests demonstrated stable flight and mission execution in sustained winds up to 8m/s, with appropriate compensation from the control system, though obstacle avoidance safety margins were automatically increased in these conditions. Lighting scenario testing covered daylight (>10,000 lux), overcast (1,000-10,000 lux), dusk/dawn (100-1,000 lux), and artificial lighting conditions. Detection performance remained optimal in daylight and overcast conditions (>90% mAP), degraded moderately in dusk/dawn settings (82% mAP), and showed more significant reduction under artificial lighting (76% mAP), particularly affecting distant object detection and classification accuracy. Temperature variation testing confirmed reliable operation between 0°C and 35°C, with computational performance decreasing by approximately 10% at the upper temperature bound due to thermal throttling. These environmental test results establish clear operational parameters for the system, defining conditions under which full or degraded performance can be expected and identifying environmental limitations that restrict safe operation.

## 8.5 Energy Efficiency

Energy efficiency analysis characterizes the power consumption and flight endurance of the autonomous drone system across various operational modes. Component power draw measurements identify the propulsion system as the primary consumer (80-85% of total power), with computing systems (8-12%), sensors (3-5%), and communication systems (2-3%) comprising the remainder. The Jetson Xavier NX computing module demonstrated effective power scaling, with consumption ranging from a baseline of 7W during minimal processing to peaks of 15W during simultaneous perception and planning operations. Flight time analysis shows a maximum endurance of 24 minutes in ideal conditions (hover, no payload, minimal computation), decreasing to 20 minutes during typical autonomous operation with active perception and planning systems. The relationship between velocity and endurance follows the expected U-shaped power curve, with optimal efficiency (maximum distance per battery charge) achieved at 6-7m/s in still air conditions. Software optimization results demonstrate the effectiveness of the selective sensor activation and dynamic computation scaling described in Chapter 3, with these optimizations extending flight time by approximately 15% compared to baseline continuous operation of all systems. Hardware efficiency improvements, including optimized propeller selection and motor operating points, contributed an additional 8% endurance improvement over the initial prototype configuration. These energy efficiency metrics confirm the system's practical viability for typical mission durations while identifying energy consumption as an ongoing constraint that influences operational planning and future development priorities.

## 8.6 Safety and Reliability

Safety and reliability evaluation provides critical insight into the autonomous system's robustness and operational risk profile. Safety performance metrics demonstrate successful hazard avoidance across 98% of encountered obstacles, with the system maintaining minimum clearance distances appropriate to obstacle type and detection confidence. Emergency response testing verified appropriate reactions to various simulated failures, including communication loss (automatic return-to-home or land procedures), sensor failures (graceful degradation with modified operational parameters), and low battery conditions (prioritized landing at designated or suitable locations). The measured response time from hazard detection to evasive action averaged 120ms for the complete system, comprising perception processing (33ms), planning computation (45ms), control latency (12ms), and physical vehicle response time (30ms). Long-term reliability testing across 150+ flight hours identified the most common fault modes as occasional perception misclassifications (2.3 per flight hour, typically corrected in subsequent frames), navigation replanning events due to unexpected obstacles (1.7 per flight hour, handled automatically), and sensor data inconsistencies requiring filter reinitialization (0.4 per flight hour, managed through redundant sensing). Mean time between maintenance (MTBM) analysis indicates requirements for sensor calibration every 20 flight hours, software updates every 50 flight hours, and mechanical inspection every 15 flight hours, establishing a practical maintenance schedule for operational deployment. These safety and reliability metrics validate the system's suitability for autonomous operation within its defined parameters, with appropriate risk management through fault detection, redundancy, and graceful degradation capabilities.

## 8.7 Comparative Analysis

Comparative analysis positions the developed system within the context of other autonomous drone platforms, including both commercial products and research systems. Performance comparison with commercial platforms indicates that the developed system offers superior obstacle avoidance capabilities in complex environments compared to consumer drones (DJI Mavic series, Skydio 2), while providing more flexible autonomous navigation than industrial mapping platforms (DJI Matrice series, Wingtra One). The primary advantages relative to commercial systems include the more sophisticated obstacle avoidance approach, class-specific behavioral adaptations, and deeper integration between perception and planning systems. Research system comparison shows comparable perception accuracy to other recent implementations of vision-based drone navigation, with advantages in computational efficiency and real-time performance due to the optimizations described in Chapter 4. The multi-layer obstacle avoidance architecture demonstrates improved success rates in complex environments compared to purely reactive or purely deliberative approaches reported in the literature. Cost-benefit analysis indicates that the developed system achieves its enhanced capabilities with approximately 20% higher hardware cost than comparable commercial platforms, a reasonable premium for the advanced autonomous functionality. The innovation assessment identifies the layered obstacle avoidance architecture, perception-planning integration approach, and resource-adaptive processing as the most significant contributions relative to the current state of the art. This comparative analysis confirms that the developed system advances the field in targeted areas while maintaining practical viability for real-world applications.

## 8.8 Limitations and Challenges

Limitations and challenges identified during field testing provide important context for understanding the system's capabilities and constraints. Technical limitations include detection challenges for certain obstacle types, particularly thin structures (wires, poles) at distances beyond 15 meters, highly reflective surfaces in bright conditions, and visually complex backgrounds that reduce classification confidence. Navigation constraints include reduced performance in extremely dense obstacle fields where planning space becomes highly constrained, GPS-denied environments where position drift accumulates over time without external corrections, and very narrow passages (less than 2m width) that approach the limits of control precision and safety margins. Operational challenges encompass battery endurance limitations restricting typical missions to 20 minutes or less, weather sensitivity particularly to precipitation and strong winds (>8m/s), and recovery complexity after certain failure modes that may require operator intervention. Processing limitations occasionally manifest during high-demand scenarios when multiple subsystems require peak computational resources simultaneously, resulting in minor processing delays though rarely affecting critical functions due to the priority-based resource allocation. These identified limitations establish the boundaries of the system's operational envelope, defining conditions under which performance may degrade or where missions should be modified to accommodate system constraints. While these limitations restrict certain applications, they represent well-understood boundaries rather than fundamental flaws in the approach, providing clear direction for future enhancements.

## 8.9 Future Improvements

Future improvements identified based on field testing results establish a roadmap for continued development and enhancement of the autonomous drone system. Hardware enhancements under consideration include higher capacity batteries using emerging cell technologies to extend flight time by 30-40%, more powerful computing platforms as they become available within similar power and weight constraints, and supplementary sensing modalities such as compact LiDAR or radar to complement vision-based perception in challenging conditions. Software improvements in development focus on enhanced GPS-denied navigation using visual landmarks and mapping for reduced position drift, more sophisticated dynamic obstacle prediction models incorporating learned behavior patterns, and energy-aware mission planning that optimizes routes for maximum efficiency based on terrain, wind, and mission priorities. Operational enhancements planned for implementation include automated pre-flight system checks that verify sensor calibration and system health, enhanced user interfaces that provide more intuitive visualization of system status and decision processes, and expanded simulation capabilities for mission rehearsal and validation prior to field deployment. Long-term research directions identified from field experience include exploration of collaborative multi-drone systems for expanded area coverage, integration of task-specific payloads such as specialized sensors or manipulation capabilities, and investigation of learning-based approaches that adapt to recurring environments or mission types. These planned improvements address the limitations identified during field testing while extending the system's capabilities to support more demanding applications and operating environments.
